# API coverage: LeadAI-provided or bring your own keys

LeadAI calls two paid external APIs:

- **Apify**, to scrape pages, posts and comments.
- **Google Gemini**, to classify comments into leads.

For **each** API, an organization chooses who provides it:

| Choice | Apify | Gemini | Starter price (monthly / yearly) |
|---|---|---|---|
| All included | LeadAI | LeadAI | $49 / $490 |
| Own Apify key | customer's key | LeadAI | $37 / $370 |
| Own Gemini key | LeadAI | customer's key | $41 / $410 |
| Bring both keys | customer's key | customer's key | $29 / $290 |

With its own key, the customer pays Apify or Google directly, and LeadAI's price is lower.

## Pricing

- **Plan price:** `price_monthly` / `price_yearly` is the **all-included** price.
- **Add-ons:** `api_addons[api][cycle]` is the amount taken off when the customer brings that API's key.
- **Allowing own keys:** `allows_byok` controls whether a plan allows own keys at all. The Free plan doesn't.
- **One pricing function:** `app/billing/plans.py: price_for(plan, coverage, cycle)` computes every price that is shown or charged: the pricing page, checkout, renewal and the partner sales kit.
- **Editing:** the Super Admin edits the add-ons in the plan editor. Together they can't exceed the plan price.

Default add-ons per month, with yearly = ×10:

| Plan | Apify | Gemini |
|---|---|---|
| Starter | $12 | $8 |
| Pro | $36 | $24 |
| Business | $96 | $64 |
| Enterprise | $240 | $160 |

## Where it is chosen

- **Pricing page:** toggles per API, on `/pricing`.
- **Checkout:** `POST /api/billing/checkout` with `api_coverage`. The subscription keeps a snapshot (`subscriptions.api_coverage`). On confirmation, the organization's coverage becomes that snapshot.
- **Org Admin → API keys & plan** (`/org-admin#integrations`): add, replace, test and remove keys, and switch each API. Owners and admins only.
- **Super Admin → organization → API keys & plan:** view the organization's coverage and switch it, with a reason. A forced switch ("courtesy") applies without payment and is audited, but can't move an API to "own" unless the organization has saved a key. The Super Admin can also remove a compromised key; a reason is required and is sent to the organization's admins.

## Changing it later

| Situation | What happens |
|---|---|
| No paid subscription (demo, trial, free) | Applies at once |
| Switch an API to your own key (a verified key is required) | Your key is used at once; the lower price starts at the next renewal |
| Switch an API back to LeadAI-provided, which the subscription didn't pay for | Costs more, so checkout at the new price; it applies once the payment is confirmed |
| Super Admin courtesy switch to LeadAI-provided | Applies at once without payment for the rest of the paid period; the renewal charges the new price |

**Renewal** (`app/billing/api_coverage.py: renewal_amount`) charges for the coverage in use at that moment. It adds or takes off only the list-price difference from the stored amount, so partner and coupon discounts are kept. The "next price" shown in the portals uses the same calculation.

**Payment providers:** with a real provider subscription (Stripe / Razorpay), the provider's recurring price must also be updated. The app records the new amount; the provider-side plan isn't changed automatically.

## Keys

- **Stored encrypted:** keys are encrypted at rest with Fernet (`app/services/secret_box.py`). The encryption key comes from `API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; if that is unset, from `SESSION_SECRET`; and in development only, from a key generated and stored once in the database.
- **Changing the encryption key** makes saved customer keys unreadable. Customers then have to enter them again.
- **Write-only:** no API response, log, audit entry or email ever contains a key. Responses carry only a masked hint (`apif…7890`) and status.
- **Verification:** keys are tested with the provider when saved. A key that fails the test is saved but marked unverified.

## At run time

- **One resolver:** `resolve_api_key(org_id, "apify" | "gemini")` (`app/services/tenant_api_keys.py`) is used by the scraper, URL search, background jobs and the AI step.
- **No fallback:** an API set to "own" **never falls back to LeadAI's key.** What happens instead depends on the API:
  - **Apify:** a missing, rejected (401/403) or out-of-credit (402) key stops the search with a clear message.
  - **Gemini:** comments are analysed with the free rule-based pass.
  - **Both:** the organization's admins are notified, at most once every 6 hours, and the error is shown on the API keys page.
- **Per-organization pauses:** a customer's rate-limited or rejected Gemini key pauses AI for that organization only. LeadAI's shared circuit breaker only guards LeadAI's own key.
- **Platform tokens** count only what LeadAI pays for. A search is 60% Apify and 40% Gemini; collecting posts is 100% Apify. The share that runs on the customer's own keys is not charged.
